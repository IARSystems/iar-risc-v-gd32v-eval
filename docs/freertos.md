# FreeRTOS

[FreeRTOS][fr-url] is a [market leading][fr-market-url] RTOS from Real Time Engineers Ltd. that supports more than 30 architectures and receives more than 100000 downloads a year. It is professionally developed, strictly quality controlled, robust, supported, and free to embed in commercial products without any requirement to expose your proprietary source code.

FreeRTOS has become the de facto standard RTOS for microcontrollers by [removing all objections to using free software][fr-oss-url], and in so doing, providing a truly compelling free software model.

FreeRTOS is truly free, even for use in commercial applications. You can take a product to market using FreeRTOS without even talking to us, let alone paying any fees, and thousands of people do just that. If, at any time, you would like to receive additional backup, or if your legal team require additional written guarantees or indemnification, then there is a simple low cost commercial upgrade path. Your peace of mind comes with the knowledge that you can opt to take the commercial route at any time you choose. Commercial licenses, and a selection of [professional middleware products][or-mw-url], are sold under the OpenRTOSÂ® brand. OpenRTOS is supplied under license from Real Time Engineers Ltd. by [WITTENSTEIN high integrity systems][or-url], a global engineering and safety company.

FreeRTOS+ is a showcase for a select group of FreeRTOS add-on components.
